# Ogar-client
An open source Ogar client, written in node.js. Based on the work done for agar-clone.

## What's left to do?
- [x] Build the basic server/website using express and handlebars
- [x] Implement file upload
- [ ] Write the javascript client in a modular way (should be easier to maintain)
- [ ] Add a skin manager
- [ ] Write a new todo list
- [ ] Add some documentation
